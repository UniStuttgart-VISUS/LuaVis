# LuaVis

Interactive framework for the visualization of flow graphs in porous media.



## Compilation

LuaVis (C++) depends on the following libraries (please use the linked repositories for compatibility):

- [LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)

## Usage

Start LuaVis by executing the *run* script.

The graph shown is the one configured in the beginning of `assets/scripts/luavis/vis/Graph.lua`.



**Note:** Your graphs and their associated images must be in a subdirectory of `assets`. You can use symbolic links to point to other directories.
